# Discourse Assigned Tab

A Discourse theme component that places a tab in the topics list called "Assigned" that shows the topics that are assigned to the current user.

> **Note:** Since the way we've configured the [discourse-assign plugin][discourse-assign] is that it is visible to staff only, the added "Assigned" topic list tab is also only visible to staff.
